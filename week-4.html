            Instructions

            In this assignment, you will add support for five new endpoints. These endpoints will support GET, POST, and DELETE requests for a user's list of favorite campsites, as well as POST and DELETE requests for a single, specific favorite campsite. You will be working with files in the nucampsiteServer folder.
            
            Task 1: Add Mongoose Schema and Model for favorites collection
            
            <!-- Create module: In the nucampsiteServer/models folder, create a new file named favorite.js. -->

            <!-- Schema: In this file, create a new Mongoose Schema named favoriteSchema. The favoriteSchema should have two fields: user and campsites.  -->
            
            <!-- Both should have the type of mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, and a ref field to their corresponding Model. The campsites field's properties should be enclosed in an array. See the assignment video for a tip on this step. 
            Model: Create and export a Model named Favorite from this Schema. -->
            
            
            Task 2: Implement the favoriteRouter and support the endpoints
            
            <!-- Create favoriteRouter: In the routes folder, create a new file named favoriteRouter.js. -->

            Import/Export: 
            <!-- Using the require function, import the express module, then also import the local file-based modules you have made: cors, authenticate, and Favorite (from the models folder), using the appropriate paths.  -->
            
            
            <!-- Create the favoriteRouter using the express.Router() method as you have done in other router modules. Then be sure to export  favoriteRouter. 
            Routes: Set up two routes using favoriteRouter.route('/') and favoriteRouter.route('/:campsiteId').  -->


            Set up CORS: 

            <!-- Preflight requests to both routes using the .options() method as you have done in the other routers, with the cors.corsWithOptions function as the first middleware in the .options method's argument list, followed by a request handler middleware that simply responds with a status code of 200.  -->

            <!-- Chain .get(), .post(), .put(), and .delete() methods to both routes, giving either the cors.cors function (for .get) or the cors.corsWithOptions function (for the rest) as the first middleware in their argument lists. -->

            <!-- Authentication: For the second middleware in the get/post/put/delete routing methods' argument lists, use the authenticate.verifyUser function.  -->

            <!-- Handle Requests: Now you will add a final request handling middleware function to each of the get/post/put/delete routing methods for both the /favorites and /favorites/:campsiteId paths. Give the function arguments of req, res, and next as appropriate.  -->
<!-- GET -->
            GET: When the user does a GET operation on '/favorites', retrieve the favorite document for that user using Favorite.find(), passing to the find method the object { user: req.user._id } as its only argument. 
            <!-- still working on stuff here -->
            To the retrieved favorite document, chain two populate() methods to populate the user and campsites refs. To the res object, set an appropriate Content-Type header and a status code of 200.

            <!-- still working on stuff here -->
            Return the favorite document using the res.json() method with the appropriate argument. 
<!-- POST -->
            POST to /favorites: When the user does a POST operation on '/favorites' by including a message in the format of [{"_id":"campsite ObjectId"},  . . . , {"_id":"campsite ObjectId"}] in the body of the message (see Testing section for example), 
            
                1. you will check if the user has an associated favorite document. 
            
            <!-- Use Favorite.findOne({campsites: req.campsites._id }) for this.  -->
             <!-- still working on stuff here -->
             <!-- you gotta use javascript here, such as forEach, includes, and push -->
                2. Then, check if the favorite document exists:
                
                3. If so, then you will check which campsites in the request body are already in the campsites array of the favorite document, if any, 
                
                4. and you will only add to the document those that are not already there. There are various ways to conduct this check. The use of JavaScript array methods forEach, includes, and push can help you with this task.  

                5. If there is no favorite document for the user, you will create a favorite document for the user and add the campsite IDs from the request body to the campsites array for the document.

                        //you can chain to the .find().toArray((err, docs) => {
                            console.log('found docs', docs)
                        }), which will convert it into an array of objects so that you can use console.log

                6. Save the favorite document, 
                
                7. set the response Content-Type header and a status code of 200, 
                
                8. and send the response back using res.json() with the favorite document as its argument.  

<!-- Delete -->
            DELETE to /favorites: When the user performs a DELETE operation on '/favorites', 
            
            use findOneAndDelete to locate the favorite document corresponding to this user and delete it. 
            
            For the response, set a status code of 200. 
            
            If a favorite document was found, then set the Content-Type header to "application/json" and return the favorite document with res.json(). 
            
            If no favorite document was found, then set the Content-Type header to 'text/plain' and use res.end() to send the response 'You do not have any favorites to delete.'
<!-- POST -->
            POST to /favorites/:campsiteId: When the user performs a POST operation on '/favorites/:campsiteId', 
            
            use findOne to locate the favorites document for the user. 
            
            Then you will add the campsite specified in the URL parameter to the favorites.campsites array, if it's not already there. 
            
            If the campsite is already in the array, then respond with a message saying "That campsite is already in the list of favorites!" 
            
            If the user has not previously defined any favorites, then you will need to create a new Favorite document for this user and add the campsite to it. 
            
            <!-- Note: As a bonus challenge, you could add error checking to make sure that the campsiteId in the URL parameter corresponds to a valid campsite, but it is not required for this assignment.  -->
<!-- DELETE -->
            DELETE to /favorites/:campsiteId: 
            
            When the user performs a DELETE operation on '/favorites/:campsiteId', use findOne to find the favorites document for the user. 

            If it exists, delete the campsite in the URL parameter req.params.campsiteId from its campsites array. There are multiple ways to approach this. Because you are deleting an element from an array and not a single document, you can not use the findOneAndDelete method. Instead, you could use a combination of indexOf and splice methods on the favorite.campsites array to remove the specified campsite. Alternatively, you could use the filter array method. 
            
            Afterward, save the document then return a response with a status code of 200, a Content-Type header of 'application/json', and the favorite document. 
            
            If no favorite document exists, return a response with a Content-Type header of 'text/plain' and a message that there are no favorites to delete.
            Unsupported: 
<!-- GET and PUT -->
            For the GET request to '/favorites/:campsiteId' and the PUT request to '/favorites' and '/favorites/:campsiteId', return a response with a status code of 403 and a message that the operation is not supported. 
            
            
            <!-- Task 3: Integrate the new router into your Express application
            Update app.js to implement the new favoriteRouter.  -->
